# pepo_cli

[DEPRECATED- 9/7/22]

Pepo CLI is a highly featureful command line-environment designed for the Sia / Skynet ecosystem containing idiomatic Kiswahili macros. 
As such it has the following features:
- Determine the real-time count of hosts on the distributed Sia hosting network
- Retrieve individualized host information or aggregated host demographics
- Review filebase buckets and bucket contents.


It is an entirely self-contained application written in Ruby and designed to be used through its textual user interface (TUI). Pepo has configurable color and sound options, and users are capable of programming macros which automate frequently performed actions using Pepo's set of commmands.

Pepo accomplishes this through the use of several Ruby gems and dependencies such as HTTParty and TTY:Prompt.
